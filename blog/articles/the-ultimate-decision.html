In this article, I will discuss about the pros and cons of responsive and adaptive design.<br>
A <strong>responsive</strong> website uses just one layout and "responsively" adjusts to better fit the user's screen.
An <strong>adaptive</strong> website has different layouts of the webpage for the differnt devices. This means that, there are multiple versions
of the same website to fit someone's device as opposed to a single, static page (that reorders or resizes content) across all devices.
<br><br>
Responsive Design makes use of media queries to target breakpoints which scale images, wraptext & adjust layouts. HTML &
CSS are used in responsive design.
Not only does adaptive design make use of css media queries they also make use of JavaScript. This is done to change
the site's HTML markup based on various device capabilities.
Examples of websites that make use of Responsive Design are <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> and
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>
while, websites that make use of Adaptive Design are <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> and
<a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.<br><br>
Let's analyse and compare the two designs:<br>
The layout of a responsive design is determined by the visitor's browser window while, that of an adaptive design is
determined by the backend.<br>
The load time of an Adaptive design is faster than a responsive design.<br>
Adaptive design is more difficult because it will require differnt layouts for differnt devices.<br>
Responsive design is easier to maintain unlike adaptive design which will require occasional maintenance especially
if there is a new design in the market.<br>
Google recommends and rewards sites with a responsive design. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/search-engine-optimization-SEO">SEO</a> finds adaptive websites challenging

<br>
✕ It is difficult to intergrate advertisement into a responsive design website - Ads are to accomodate all resolutions. Therefore, asthe site adjusts to specific screeen sizes, the ads may not properly configure.
<br><br>

<br>

✕ It takes a lot of effort to create due to the number of technical aspects.

In the early days of web design, pages were built to target a particular screen size. If the user had a 
larger or smaller screen than the designer expected, results ranged from unwanted scrollbars to overly long line lengths, and poor use of space. 
Responsive Web Design coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010 is
a graphic user interface (GUI) design approach used to create content that adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes, making a website look good on all devices  
using HTML and CSS to automatically resize a website.  
<br><br>As more various screen sizes became available, the concept of responsive design was developed, a set of practices that allows web pages to 
alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc. It is an idea that revolutionised the way we design for a
multi-device web, and in this article, i'll try my best to help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.
The use of mobile devices to surf the web continues to grow at an astronomical pace, and these devices are often constrained by 
display size and require a different approach to how content is laid out on the screen. 
Different screen sizes exist across phones, tablets, desktops, game consoles, TVs, and even wearables. Screen sizes are 
always changing, so it's important that your site can adjust to any screen size, today or in the future. In addition, 
devices have different features with which we interact with them. Most of your visitors will be using a 
touchscreen. Modern responsive design considers all of these things to optimize the experience for everyone.
<br><br>
Three techniques are used in combination. The first is the idea of fluid grids, something which was already being explored by Gillenwater.
Next we have fluid images. Using a very simple technique of setting the max-width property to 100%, images would scale
 down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the 
image's intrinsic size, but never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow, 
but not grow larger and become pixelated if the column becomes wider than the image.
The last is media query. Media Queries enable the type of layout switch that Cameron Adams had previously
 explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. 
Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.
 Responsive web design isn't a separate technology!
<br><br>
Media Queries play an important role in responsive web pages.
You can define different styles for different browser sizes.
Responsive design was only able to emerge due to it. The Media Queries Level 3 specification became a 
Candidate Recommendation in 2009, meaning that it was deemed ready for implementation in browsers. 
Media Queries allow us to run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain 
width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.
<br><br>
In responsie design it is adviced you take the 'Mobile First' approach. Scale up phone-sized designs to suit larger screens.
 Also, your design must be twice as intuitive as desktop equivalents,
 since the need for well-sized elements on smaller screens can cause cramping and confusion.
Create fluid grids and images by setting them in their native dimension. If you don’t have enough space, crop them to maximize impact.
Majorly use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs). These are XML-based file formats for 2D graphics, which support interactivity and animations.
Include breakpoints, preferrably more than 3. Prioritize and hide content to suit users’ contexts. Check your visual hierarchy and use progressive
 disclosure and navigation drawers to give users needed items first. Keep non-essential items secondary. Aim for minimalism and 
apply design patterns that maximize ease of use for users in their contexts and quicken their familiarity. 
Overall, responsive design is a powerful and economical approach, but its “easy” nature is deceptive. You can still run into difficulties if you use it without caution.
<br><br>
There is no denying that responsive web design is gaining in popularity and importance ever since 
<a href="https://google.com">Google</a> announced that mobile-friendly, responsive websites will see a boost in their search engine rank in 2015.
 There are so many benefits. It can positively impact your SEO, conversion rates, user experience, and many other aspects of 
your business that contribute to your growth. Improved user experience, increase in mobile traffic, easier maintenance, simpler website analytics, cost effective etc.
The list continues.
